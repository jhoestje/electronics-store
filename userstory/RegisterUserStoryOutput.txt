# Register User Story Implementation Summary

## User Story
"As an unregistered user, I want to register on the website with my email, password and username by clicking on the register button, so that I can be a registered user and be able to login and make purchases."

## Changes Made

1. Created a new Register page (Register.tsx)
   - Created a user-friendly registration form that collects username, email, password, and password confirmation
   - Implemented form validation using Formik and Yup for field validation
   - Connected to the existing backend registration API endpoint
   - Added automatic login after successful registration for a seamless user experience
   - Added a link to return to the login page for users who already have accounts

2. Updated App.tsx
   - Added the Register component import
   - Added a new route for the registration page (/register)

3. Modified Login.tsx
   - Added a link to the registration page for users who don't have accounts yet
   - Maintained consistent styling with the existing application theme

## Implementation Notes

- Maintained the existing theme styling to ensure a consistent user experience
- Leveraged the existing authentication system (Redux store, API service) to integrate the registration functionality
- Added validation for email format, password strength, and password confirmation matching
- The registration form follows the same UI patterns as the login form for consistency
- After successful registration, users are automatically logged in to provide a smooth onboarding experience

The implementation now allows unregistered users to easily create accounts and access the full functionality of the electronics store, including making purchases.
