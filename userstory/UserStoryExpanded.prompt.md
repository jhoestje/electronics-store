I want to update the electronics-store with the user story in /userstory/RegisterUserStory.txt and keep the same theme style and create an output file in /userstory/RegisterUserStoryOutput.txt to add a summmary of what changed and why and then create spring boot integration tests based on test scenarios in /userstory/RegistrationAPITests.feature so that the created code passes all the tests
